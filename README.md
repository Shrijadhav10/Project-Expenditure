# 💰 Expense Analysis Dashboard

This project is an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** where I transformed raw expense data into meaningful insights using **Python (Pandas)** and **Power BI**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Raw expense data was unstructured (multiple months, repeated headers, merged cells, totals, blanks).
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset using **Python (Pandas)**.
- Built an **interactive dashboard in Power BI** to analyze spending patterns by:
  - Year
  - Month / Quarter
  - Expense Categories (e.g., Rent, Loan, Food, Travel)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, Regex, Excel I/O)** → Data cleaning & preprocessing
- **Power BI** → Data visualization and reporting
- **GitHub** → Project sharing & version control

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Monthly and yearly expenditure tracking
- Top spending categories (Rent, Loan, Food, Travel, etc.)
- Drill-down slicers: Year → Quarter → Month
- Grouped similar categories (e.g., "Rent", "Room rent" → Rent)
